\section{Type Soundness}
No, ``subject expansion'' does not hold for $\lambda^{\rightarrow}$. Consider

$$ (\fun x \tau {\fun y \sigma y})~\Omega \rightarrow \fun y \sigma y $$

The left-hand side isn't type-able because $\Omega$ appears as a subterm, but
the righthand side has the type $\sigma \rightarrow \sigma$.
