\section{Approximation}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Suppose $x \ll y$. Consider the chain with one element $y$. The supremum of this chain is $y$ which is at least $y$ by reflexivity so this chain must contain an element that is at least $x$. Since the only element of the chain is $y$, it must be that $x \sqsubseteq y$.
