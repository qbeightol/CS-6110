  % NOTE: this translation doesn't work. Try translating something with a
  % top-level application (ex: Î©). But it might have some salvageable ideas.

  Use $\translate{e}{V}$ to translate a lambda term $e$ in a context
  where the list of variables $V$ are in scope. The order of variables indicate
  when the variable was introduced. E.g. the variables for translating $e$ in
  $\lambda x. \lambda y. e$ would be $V = x, y$)

  \begin{eqnarray*}
    \translate{x}{x, V}         & \defined & \I                  \\
    \translate{x}{y, V}         & \defined & \K~\translate{x}{V} \\
    \translate{\lambda x. e}{V} & \defined & \translate{e}{V,x}  \\
    \translate{e_1~e_2}{V}      & \defined & \S~\translate{e_1}{V}~\translate{e_2}{V}
  \end{eqnarray*}

  To translate closed $\lambda$-terms, use the empty context (denoted $\cdot$).
